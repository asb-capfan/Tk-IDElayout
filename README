		  The Tk::IDElayout Widget
		*************************************

INTRODUCTION

Tk::IDElayout is a widget for managing the layout of Tk frames
(and other widgets) like an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
similar to Eclipse or Microsoft Visual Studio.

Features:

See "Screenshots.pdf" in the source distribution for some screenshots
demonstrating some of these features.

* Layout and management of subwidgets/frames similar to an IDE.
	
* Resizable panes: Separate frames/widgets in the top-level window can be resized by dragging
the separator border between the frames.
	
* Support for Tabbed-Frames (using of subclass of L<Tk::DynaTabFrame>, where each tab
can be dragged/dropped; to another tabframe in the IDE, or to a new separate window,
or to "edge" ares in the mainwindow to create new tabframes.


BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE WIDGET

1. Uncompress and unpack the distribution

   ON UNIX:
	gzip -d Tk-TableMatrix<version>.tar.gz
	tar -xf Tk-TableMatrix<version>.tar

   ON WINDOWS:
	use something like WinZip to unpack the archive.

    
   This will create a subdirectory TableMatrix<version> with all the files in it.

2. Build/Test

  Note: A c-compiler is required, due to the CaptureRelease extension, which enables windows
  to be released from the IDE to separate windows and captured back to the IDE.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make 
    make test
    
 The test case t/simpleIDElayout2.t serves a simple demo. Run it using
    perl -Mblib t/simpleIDElayout2.t
   
3. Install
    make install

4. Read the documentation

   Read it using the standard 'perldoc Tk::IDElayout' command.
